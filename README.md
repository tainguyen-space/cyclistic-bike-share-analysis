# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes bike-share usage data for Cyclistic (a fictional company based on Divvy data)
to identify behavioral differences between annual members and casual riders.
The goal is to support data-driven marketing strategies to increase annual memberships.

## Business Question
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## Data Source
- Public Divvy bike-share data (2024)
- Provided by Motivate International Inc.
- Data includes ride timestamps, locations, rideable types, and membership type

## Tools Used
- SQL (MySQL)
- Tableau
- GitHub

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Combined 12 monthly datasets (~6 million rows)
- Standardized datetime formats
- Removed invalid timestamps and coordinates
- Engineered ride duration and time-based features
- Created weekday, monthly, and hourly dimensions

## Key Insights
- Annual members take significantly more rides, but with shorter average duration
- Casual riders show strong leisure-based patterns, especially on weekends and evenings
- Members peak during commuting hours (6–8 AM, ~5 PM)
- Both groups peak during summer months, with casual riders more seasonally sensitive

## Visualizations
(Visualizations created in Tableau and exported as images)

## Recommendations
- Introduce reward-based programs to incentivize frequent casual riders to convert
- Promote safety and late-night features for casual riders
- Launch seasonal and weekend-focused membership campaigns

## Skills Demonstrated
